The project is customized to satisfy student needs and learn or apply knowledge in greater depth. Term project requires significant more time and effort, but in return you get experience. Please meet with the instructor to discuss your project. You need to work closely with the instructor and regularly report your progress.

Development project

The development project focuses on the development of a mobile friendly website, mobile web or hybrid application, for various purposes. The development project emphasizes on a more complete and working application that requires some analysis and design. It addresses a real-world problem in a more practical context with fewer assumptions. Additional learning may be needed beyond the class, but it is rather limited. The functionalities and scope of the project can be negotiated, but generally it is at least equivalent to three class assignments.
The development project gives students a chance to apply their knowledge and skills in a real-world web site or application project. The project may be different from semester to semester.


There are four choices of development project:
1.	Redesign a mobile friendly website for an existing live website which is not mobile optimized.
2.	Develop a mobile friendly website for a real organization which has no website.
--> 3.	Replicate or even improve an existing web or mobile app using mobile web technologies.
4.	Proposed and develop a completely new web or hybrid app.
